in this, i want to create a tournament system players can compete in (vs AI)

Events Breakdown 4x Regionals (each with its own open qualifier) 2x Majors (featuring top performers from Regionals) 1x Worlds (season finale & championship)

Formats Open Qualifiers Format: Single Elim Best of 3 matches 2–5 matches per player (depending on progress) Top 32 → Regional Regionals Format: Double Elim Best of 5 matches Top 8 → Major Majors Format: Double Elim Best of 7 matches Top 4 → Worlds Worlds Format: Double Elim Best of 9 matches Winner = Season Champion Advancement Rules Players may enter any open qualifier. Once a player qualifies for a major, they cannot qualify for another regional of that same major. If a player qualifies for a major but does not reach Worlds, they may still attempt in later qualifiers for the next major. Once a player qualifies for Worlds, they can no longer enter future regionals or majors. Extra Incentives (Polish) Regional Champion Bonus: Winning a regional gives the champion a seed advantage at the corresponding major (example: auto-start in Winners Round 2, or a first-round bye). If a Regional Champion doesn’t make Top 4 at the major, they still get a small “Worlds Points” bonus (e.g., tiebreaker priority if needed).

near the end of each season opens up the event (last 7 days), player plays their games, try to qualify for regionals, then majors, then worlds, etc

players / ai can be rewarded titles based off how well they do (all titles are already in the code)
